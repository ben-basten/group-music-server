# Music Server with Group Listening

_AKA "Listening Party"!_

A .mp3 music file server with listening rooms for multiple clients to join, add to queue, skip songs, and listen to the same music. By sharing the unique room code, friends, family, and peers can join the room and have a Listening Party!

This is my senior project at NMU for the CS480 course.

## Getting Started

___

**Running Frontend - React**

* Navigate into the src/main/js folder and run the command `npm install`.
* `npm start` - runs the React frontend. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it.

___

**Running Backend - Spring Boot**

* _First time only:_ In the root directory, run the command `gradle clean build`. This will install all necessary dependencies and run unit/integration tests.
* `gradle :bootRun` - starts the Spring Boot server. After compiling is done, the server will be listening on port 8080.
* Assuming that the frontend is already running, all requests to port 3000 will be proxied to port 8080 by React. Test that the frontend and backend are running as expected by navigating to [localhost:3000/api/gms/hello](http://localhost:8080/api/gms/hello) in your browser or Postman. You should see a simple "hello" message with the current date and time.

**Adding music**

Put .mp3 music files into `src/main/resources/music`. The tracks are indexed during initial runtime, so a server restart is necessary if the files in the music directory change. The music can be in folders up to 2 directories deep. To clarify, the following music files would ALL be indexed:

1. `music/song.mp3`
2. `music/folder1/song.mp3`
3. `music/folder1/folder2/song.mp3`

___

**Swagger Interactive Documentation**

Once Spring Boot is running, the auto-generated interactive API documentation can be viewed at [localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

If you prefer to use Postman instead, a Postman collection is available here: `src/main/resources/group-music-server.postman_collection.json`

## Technologies Used

* Frontend - React, generated by create-react-app
    * Websockets: @stomp/stompjs from npm (STOMP messaging over websockets)
* Backend - Spring Boot with Kotlin and Gradle
* Testing - Spock framework with Groovy
